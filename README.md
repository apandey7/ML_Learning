ML algorithms and their implementations

This repo contains all ML algos that have been implemented by me.

This file contains the ML pipeline of implementation of algos, namely following steps:
1.  EDA Process
2.  Missing value treatment
3.  Splitting into Train, Test, Validation
4. Model implementation, including but not limited to:
   - Logistic R
   - SVM
   - MLP
   - RF - To be completed
5. Hyperparameter tuning for each algorithm
